    <h1>Long distance relationship</h1>
    <h2>photograph ed sheeran</h2>

    <p>
        So you can keep me
<i>Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans</i>
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet You won't ever be alone, <b>wait for me to come home</b>
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier <u>Remember that with every piece of ya</u>
 Hmm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
Hmm, we keep this love in this photograph We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing Hearts were never broken And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me That's okay, baby, only words bleed Inside these pages,
 you just hold me And I won't ever let you go
<mark>Wait for me to come home</mark>
